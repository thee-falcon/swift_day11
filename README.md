## Structs, part two.

learn about some of the more advanced features of structs that make them more powerful, including static properties and access control – the art of stopping other parts of your code from meddling in places they ought not to be.

There’s a famous quote that is sadly anonymous, but I think it fits well here: “Privacy is power – what people don’t know, they can’t ruin.” As you’ll see, the same is true in Swift: hiding access to certain properties and methods can make our code better because there are fewer places able to access it.
